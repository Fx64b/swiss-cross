I will try to respond as fast as possible and implement a fix if I think it is necessary.

## Security Considerations

This is a simple React component with no external dependencies beyond React itself. Security risks are minimal, but I try to:

- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Follow secure coding practices
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use TypeScript for type safety
